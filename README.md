# SOLID Principles - simple and easy explanation

SOLID Principles is a coding standard that all developers should have a clear 
concept for developing software in a proper way to avoid a bad design. 
It was promoted by Robert C Martin and is used across the object-oriented design spectrum.
When applied properly it makes your code more extendable, logical and easier to read.

When the developer builds a software follow the bad design, the code can become 
inflexible and more brittle, small changes in the software can result in bugs. 
For these reasons, we should follow SOLID Principles.


It takes some time to understand, but coding to follow the principles that can greatly 
improve code quality and even understanding of the most well-designed applications on the web.

I'm going to try to explain SOLID Principles in simplest way so that it's easy 
for beginners to understand. Let's go through each principle one by one:
